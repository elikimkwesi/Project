Older spots are black, slightly raised, superficial and measure up to 0.3 inch (7.5 mm) in diameter. Larger leaf blotches may also occur, especially on the margins of leaves. Symptoms on immature fruit are at first slightly sunken and surrounded by a water-soaked halo, which soon disappears. Fruit spots enlarge, turn brown, and become scabby.',

Secondary spread within a field occurs by splashing water from sprinkler irrigation or rain. Infection is favored by high relative humidity and free moisture on the plant.\n\n4. Symptoms develop rapidly at temperatures of 68째F (20째C) and above. Night temperatures of 61째F (16째C) or below suppress disease development regardless of day temperatures.\n\n5.

Inspect plants very carefully and reject infected transplants- including your own! In the greenhouse, discard trays adjacent to outbreak location to minimize disease spread. In transplant production greenhouses, minimize overwatering and handling of seedlings when they are wet.\n\n3. Trays, benches, tools, and greenhouse structures should be washed and sanitized between seedlings crops. Crop rotation should be used to avoid pathogen carryover on volunteers and crop residue.\n\n4. Avoid fields that have been planted with peppers or tomatoes within one year, especially if they had bacterial spot previously.\n\n5. Eliminate solanaceous weeds in and around tomato and pepper production areas. Keep cull piles away from field operations. Do not spray, tie, harvest, or handle wet plants as that can spread the disease.',
